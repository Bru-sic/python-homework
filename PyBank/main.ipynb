    "## Summary\n",
    "This script analyses financial records contained in a csv file (configured with INPUT_PATH and INPUT_DATA_FILENAME settings). It then \n",
    "genenrates a report (which is output to the terminal and to the a text file (configured with OUTPUT_PATH and OUTPUT_DATA_FILENAME settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "1. There will always be 2 columns present in the order provided in the sample data\n",
    "2. A header column is present (could down the track add more complex validation to automatically detect header presence)\n",
    "The csv file is expected to contain:\n",
    "* A Header Row with two columns \"Date\" and \"Profit/Losses\"\n",
    "* \"Date\" column in the format of MMM-YYYY (for example Jan-2011)\n",
    "* \"Profit/Losses\" column numeric type (rounded to whole numbers) which may be positive or negative.\n",
    "* Records are sorted in ascending order by Date\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Date,Profit/Losses\n",
    "Jan-2010,867884\n",
    "Feb-2010,984655\n",
